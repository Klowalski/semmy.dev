I build software from Kyiv, Ukraine. We're at war. That context shapes every technical decision I make.

This isn't a political post. It's about how **constraints drive better architecture**.

## The Power Situation

Ukraine gets ~12 hours of electricity per day. Not consecutive. Not predictable.

What that means for development:
- **No always-on local hardware** — Everything runs on VPS (Hetzner)
- **Manual generator management** — Charging station requires intervention
- **Intermittent connectivity** — Architecture must handle disconnects gracefully

**Lesson**: If your system breaks during a 4-hour power outage, you designed it wrong.

### Technical Adaptations

**1. VPS-First Architecture**
My main PC (AMD 7800X3D, RTX 4070Ti) can't be always-on. So:
- OpenClaw gateway: Hetzner VPS (24/7)
- Databases: SQLite on VPS (not local PostgreSQL)
- Services: Docker containers on VPS

**2. State Management**
Every service assumes it might disappear mid-operation:
- Write-ahead logging for critical state
- Idempotent operations (safe to retry)
- No in-memory-only state

**3. Graceful Degradation**
Example: My AI agent (Klowalski) runs on VPS. When my PC loses power:
- Agent continues autonomous work
- Results saved to shared workspace
- I catch up when power returns

No data loss. No confused state. Just resilience.

## Security Mindset

Russian intelligence agencies have demonstrated capability and intent to compromise Ukrainian infrastructure. That's not paranoia — it's threat modeling.

### Encryption-First Design

Every project starts with:
- **TLS everywhere** — Even internal services
- **At-rest encryption** — Sensitive data encrypted on disk
- **End-to-end where possible** — Trust no intermediary

Example: Memory Chain supports AES-256-GCM for sensitive memories. Even if someone gets the chain file, they can't read encrypted entries without keys.

### Zero-Trust Networking

- **Tailscale for SSH** — No public SSH ports (removed on Feb 15)
- **VPN-only admin panels** — Mattermost, Fizzy, etc. not public
- **Hardware tokens** — YubiKey for critical auth (migration planned)

**Lesson**: If you're in a hostile environment, assume every connection is monitored. Design accordingly.

## Intermittent Connectivity

Internet in Ukraine is reliable... until it isn't. Russian attacks target telecom infrastructure.

### Offline-First Patterns

**1. Local-First Storage**
- SQLite databases (work offline, sync later)
- Git for code (commit locally, push when connected)
- Append-only logs (never lose data)

**2. Queue-Based Communication**
Instead of:
```javascript
await sendEmail(); // Fails if offline
```

Do:
```javascript
await emailQueue.add(message); // Always succeeds
// Worker processes queue when connected
```

**3. Conflict-Free Data**
Design data structures that merge cleanly:
- CRDTs where appropriate
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution
- Append-only chains (Memory Chain does this)

### Real Example: Govantazh

Cargo management SaaS built for Ukraine logistics:
- **Multi-tenant SQLite** — Each tenant's data is a file
- **Email ingestion queue** — Gmail parser doesn't fail on network blips
- **Offline dashboard** — React 19 with aggressive caching

Works when internet is sketchy. Still ships Monday.

## Time Management

War means unpredictable interruptions:
- Air raid sirens
- Power schedule changes
- Mental load

### Adaptation: Micro-Commits

I commit code in small chunks:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user auth"        # ❌ Too big
git commit -m "feat: add login form UI"    # ✅ Shippable
git commit -m "feat: add auth API route"   # ✅ Shippable
git commit -m "feat: connect login to API" # ✅ Shippable
```

Why? If an air raid interrupts work at 2am, I want shippable state at every commit. Not half-finished features that don't compile.

**Palmer Principle** (from my AGENTS.md):
> "Always leave a session in a state where future-you understands what happened."

Same logic. Future-you might be dealing with an air raid. Make their life easier.

## Optimizing for Low Resources

VPS specs: Hetzner CAX21 (8GB RAM, 4 vCPU ARM64)

Running:
- OpenClaw gateway (~940MB)
- Mattermost (~120MB)
- Matrix homeserver (~90MB)
- Fizzy Kanban (~260MB)
- Viatex production site (~160MB)
- Traefik reverse proxy (~20MB)

**Total: ~1.6GB of ~8GB used**

How?
1. **Alpine Linux containers** — Minimal base images
2. **Aggressive caching** — Turbo, pnpm, Docker layers
3. **Lazy loading** — Services start on-demand
4. **Smart scheduling** — Cron jobs during low-usage hours

**Lesson**: RAM constraints force elegant architecture. Bloat is a choice.

## What Ukraine Taught Me

**1. Resilience > Features**
A feature that breaks under stress is worse than no feature. Design for hostile conditions.

**2. Offline-First Wins**
Even in peace, networks fail. Power goes out. Laptops disconnect. Offline-first patterns aren't "Ukraine-specific" — they're just good engineering.

**3. Constraints Breed Creativity**
No always-on hardware? Use VPS. No reliable internet? Queue everything. Limited RAM? Optimize ruthlessly.

**4. Security Isn't Optional**
In peacetime, security is "best practice." In wartime, it's survival. But the techniques (encryption, zero-trust, hardware tokens) work everywhere.

**5. Ship Small, Ship Often**
You never know when the next interruption comes. Keep work in shippable state. Micro-commits. Continuous deployment.

## Tools I Rely On

- **VPS**: Hetzner (Germany) — Reliable, ARM64, cheap
- **VPN**: Tailscale — Zero-config mesh networking
- **Backup**: Restic + Backblaze — Encrypted off-site backups
- **Comms**: Matrix — Self-hosted, E2E encrypted
- **Auth**: YubiKey (planned) — Hardware 2FA
- **Monitoring**: UptimeRobot — Know when services go down

All chosen for **resilience under adversity**.

## For Developers in Stable Environments

You probably have:
- 24/7 electricity
- Gigabit internet
- No air raids

Lucky you. But don't let comfort make you lazy.

Ask yourself:
- What happens if AWS has a 6-hour outage?
- What if your database gets compromised?
- Can your users work offline?

**Build like Ukraine forced me to build**: resilient, encrypted, offline-capable, shippable at every commit.

Not because war is coming to you. Because that's just better software.

**Currently shipping from Kyiv:**
- Govantazh (cargo SaaS) — Monday deploy
- Memory Chain (AI agent memory) — Live on Base
- semmy.dev (this site) — Built by my AI agent overnight

All built with 12h/day electricity. All deployed to Hetzner VPS. All designed for hostile conditions.

**Slava Ukraini** 🇺🇦
